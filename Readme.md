# My Journey into Computer Vision 🚀

## About This Repository
This repository marks the beginning of my **journey into Computer Vision (CV)**.  
Here, I will document my **learning, projects, and experiments** as I explore AI/ML techniques to understand and interpret visual data.  

My goal is to **master state-of-the-art CV methods** and build real-world applications in image and video analysis.

## Why Computer Vision?
Computer Vision allows machines to **see, understand, and interact with the world visually**.  
Some of the exciting applications I aim to explore:
- Image classification and object detection
- Facial recognition and emotion analysis
- Medical imaging and anomaly detection
- Autonomous vehicles and robotics
- AI-driven creativity (art, photo enhancement, etc.)

## My Learning Roadmap

1. **Foundations**
   - Image processing basics (OpenCV, PIL)
   - Data handling and augmentation
   - Classical computer vision algorithms

2. **Deep Learning for CV**
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
   - Transfer learning with pretrained models (Inception, ResNet, EfficientNet)
   - Fine-tuning and model optimization

3. **Advanced Topics**
   - Object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
   - Segmentation (Mask R-CNN, U-Net)
   - Generative models (GANs for images)
   - Video analysis and action recognition

4. **Projects & Competitions**
   - Kaggle CV competitions
   - Hackathons and collaborative projects
   - Personal portfolio projects (e.g., Car vs Truck classification, HanuVision, etc.)

---

## Current Focus
- Learning **transfer learning** in Keras/TensorFlow
- Training **binary image classifiers** using pretrained networks
- Building a **strong understanding of data pipelines** and model evaluation

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV, PIL
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- TensorFlow Hub for pretrained models

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Master CV fundamentals and advanced architectures
- Build a portfolio of real-world projects
- Apply CV in AI/ML startups and research
- Share learnings and code to help others in the CV community
